# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor
## Overview

Using a combination of HTML and CSS we learned how to make a website more accessible to the end user while also organizing the code of the website to make it more readable for developers. We also used Git to keep track of and document any changes that we made throughout the development of this project.


### HTML

In this project I learned how to use HTML semantic tags to better organize the HTML of the website. Replacing all of the "div" tags with semantic tags like "main" and "article" really helped me understand where I was on the website while just looking at the HTML. Also, I learned the importance of using alt text with an image so that anyone who uses a screen reader is able to more easily understand what a website looks like. Lastly, I created a title for the website to better represent what the user should expect when they navigate to it.

### CSS

Because the CSS of this website was already complete in the starter code, I only had to update some of the paths that the CSS was targeting to match with the updated HTML semantic tags. For example, changing “.header div ul {}” to “.header nav ul {}”.

### Git

Using git commands, I practiced creating branches, adding and committing changes to that branch, as well as pushing and merging new code to my github repository. Also, using the issues feature of github helped me figure out what things actually needed to be done to finish this project. Lastly, learning how to publish my code to github pages was a little tricky at first, but after figuring out what was wrong, it was satisfying to see the webpage go live.
